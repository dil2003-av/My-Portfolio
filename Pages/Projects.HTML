      <p style="background-color: blanchedalmond;">I created a Tic-Tac-Toe game using Java, applying object-oriented programming concepts like classes, methods, 
        and encapsulation. The user interface was designed with JavaFX and Scene Builder, ensuring a clean and 
        interactive layout. This project 
        demonstrates my skills in Java, OOP, and UI development while delivering a simple yet engaging gaming experience.</p>

        <h3><strong><u> <i>SUN HOUSE RESTAURANT MANAGMENT SYSTEM</i></u></strong></h3>
        <img src="/images/LoginPage.png" alt="LoginPage" style="width: 600px;height: 400px;">
        <p style="background-color: blanchedalmond;">I developed the Sun House Restaurant System using Java, incorporating object-oriented programming concepts to 
          ensure scalability and maintainability. The user interface was crafted with JavaFX and Scene Builder, providing an 
          intuitive and user-friendly design. The system integrates a MySQL database for efficient data management, utilizing 
          JDBC for seamless database connectivity. This project streamlines restaurant operations, including managing orders, reservations, and inventory, 
          showcasing my expertise in Java programming, OOP principles, database integration, and UI/UX development.</p>
